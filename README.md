## Getting Started
This program was built using Visual Studio 2017 and is recommended to use VS2017 to test for best results. <br />

It can also be ran by the `Syntactic-Analyzer.exe` in the `Syntactic-Analyzer/Debug` folder. Just make sure the the text file that is being ran is in the same location.

While running the program, the program will ask you to insert a text file. Make sure to include the file extension.
```
>> Enter file name: file_name.txt
```
